{"name":"Rajat Kant Goel","tagline":"An undergrad in Computer Engineering, poet and writer at heart","body":"### About me\r\nI am an undergraduate student at Zakir Husain College of Engineering & Technology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh, specializing in Computer Engineering. Being a computer enthusiast since High School, I have always been fascinated by the power of computations and changes it has brought to the world. An aspiring MS graduate, I intend to enhance my knowledge in the area of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I would love to collaborate with people doing projects in these areas.\r\n\r\nEnough said of technical background, I am also one of those writers that seek inspiration in anything and everything to write one thing or the other. Be it poetry or articles for blog, newspaper or even student applications for various issues, I don't mind as far as it's concerned with writing.
