<p align="justify">I am a 2016 passout Bachelors in Computer Engineering student at Zakir Husain College of Engineering &amp; Technology, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh. Being a computer enthusiast since High School, I have always been fascinated by the power of computations and changes it has brought to the world. A future Masters in Computer Science Student at Arizona State University, I intend to enhance my knowledge in the area of Big Data, Devops, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. I would love to collaborate with people doing projects in these areas.</p>

<p align="justify">Regarding my industry experience, I have worked at Exadatum Softwares, Pune as a Big Data Engineer. As a Big Data Engineer, I got an oppurtunity to work on domains like Retail and Healthcare and technologies like Hadoop, Spark, Docker, AWS, Python, Java, Scala, Apache Nutch, Neo4J, Play Framework and Salt-Stack. At Exadatum, I worked on two projects namely "Recommendation System and Chat-bot" in a four member team and "Ingestion, Data Analysis and Visualization of Cardiovascular Patient Data" in a three member team. The project “Recommendation System and Chat-bot” is related to the retail domain which involves creating a knowledge base by crawling the web and also creating a recommendation system and a chat-bot and training them with the knowledge base. My second project was “Ingestion, Data Analysis and Visualization of Cardiovascular Patient Data” is related to healthcare domain and it involves creating an end to end flow starting from extracting the patient data from the source, then passing the data to various data analysis algorithm and visualizing the output in the form of tables and slice and dice charts. I was also responsible for designing and creating the environment for deploying the application as docker containers on AWS EC2 instances, while also adding the functionality of continuous integration using Jenkins and automating the deployment process with the help of Salt-Stack. Also, besides working on my projects I had actively contributed to the company products like XStream and XInterview.
</p>
<p align="justify"> Besides this, I have also completed three internships which further helped me in gaining industrial exposure. I have completed a internship in backend web development in Django at a startup named Martian based in India. Also, I have successfully completed a research internship with Dr. Sukant Khurana at CSIR-CDRI on Automatic Epilepsy Detection and Prediction. My forth internship that I completed is related to Deep Learning at Radix Softwares, New Delhi. In this internship I was exposed to various machine learning and deep learning concepts as well as libraries like Tensorflow and Keras.</p>
